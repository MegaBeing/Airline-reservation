# Airline Reservation

## Introduction

This was my first project, completed during my first semester. The application facilitates airline reservations, primarily for dummy airlines. It serves as an excellent introduction to application development and basic file handling in Python.

## Features

- Developed using Tkinter for the graphical user interface.
- No backend frameworks were used; everything was built from scratch.
- Data is saved to a file using Python's `os` module and basic file reading and writing operations.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airline-reservation.git
    cd airline-reservation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install Tkinter if not already installed:
    ```bash
    # For Debian-based systems
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    # For Red Hat-based systems
    sudo yum install python3-tkinter
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the application as follows:

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python airline_reservation.py
    ```

2. Use the GUI to make and manage airline reservations. The data will be saved in a file for persistence.

## Conclusion

This Airline Reservation application is a simple yet effective project, ideal for beginners. It can be used as a baseline to create a more scalable and sophisticated application. The project emphasizes understanding the basics of GUI development with Tkinter and file handling in Python.
